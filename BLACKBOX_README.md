# Server

This project contains the source code for a simple Node.js server. The server is configured using the dotenv package, which allows you to load environment variables from a .env file.

## Installation

To install the dependencies for this project, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command:

```
node app.js
```

The server will listen on port 3000 by default. You can change the port by setting the PORT environment variable.

## Code

The following is a detailed explanation of the code in the app.js file:

```
require('dotenv').config();
```

This line imports the dotenv package and loads the environment variables from the .env file.

```
const Server = require('./models/server');
```

This line imports the Server class from the models/server.js file.

```
const server = new Server()
```

This line creates a new instance of the Server class.

```
server.listen()
```

This line starts the server. The server will listen on port 3000 by default. You can change the port by setting the PORT environment variable.
